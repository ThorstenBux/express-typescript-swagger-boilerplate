# express-typescript-swagger-boilerplate
Boilerplate to create REST webservices using Express, Tyepscript and Swagger. Inclusive automatic swagger.json and route creation from controller-modules. 

Enhanced by Inversify to enable dependency injection (DI)

I used [tsoa](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsoa) for automatic Swagger doc generation, [InversifyJS](https://github.com/inversify/InversifyJS) for DI, [ExpressJS](https://expressjs.com/) as server and enhanced it with [Typescript](typescriptlang.org)


Look at https://www.npmjs.com/package/tsoa for more information about Swagger generation and usage of Inversify with tsoa
